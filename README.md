# RequestNetwork.py
A python implementation of the [Request Network API](https://github.com/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork.js)

NOTE: Not currently functional

The project aims to mirror the structure of the original API so that one can transition seamlessly between implementations. If contributing please do your best to mirror the original RequestNetwork.js project structure. To contribute simply open a pull request. 

NOTE: All file names with a `-` (hyphen or dash, call it what you will) should be converted to use a `_` (underscore), as Python does not allow module names with `-` (hyphen/dash) in them.
